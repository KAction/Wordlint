2015-02-27 - version 0.2.1.0
============================

- --whitelist [FILE] option and filter has been added.
	This is the final filter run against the word lists. The whitelist
	file should follow the same format as the blacklist. Only words
	that match entries in the whitelist will be output.

2015-02-19 - version 0.2.0.0
============================

This version brings breaking changes if you typically
use a non-default set of linting arguments.

- Command line arguments -w/--wordlength, -d/--distance and -t/--type
  have been removed.

- The -m/--matchlength replaces -w/--wordlength

- The-w/--words, -l/--lines, and -p/--percent take Int/Int/Double, respectively.
  The parameter itself represents the type of lint you wish to perform, while the
  argument provided by the user indicates the maximum distance between matches.

- Intersecting lints have been added. The type/distance arguments provided (or not)
  are used to create a set of lists. The intersection of these lists
  is provided as the end result.

- Some granularity in the human-readable data has been lost. Due to the addition of
  intersecting lints, all final results are treated as Doubles, and the "intervening
  distance" between word pairs are unlabeled. This is no issue if running one type of
  lint, but with more, it is difficult to sort out which unit is being provided. 

- Wordlint.hs has been heavily manicured.

- Wordlint.Linters and the `Linter` datatype and associated functions have been
  taken the place of the `run*Linter` family of functions in Wordlint.hs

- Wordlint.Output has been added to house the Human/Machine functions from Wordlint.hs.
  These functions have been pruned and some higher-level functions added.
